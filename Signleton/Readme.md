# Singleton Pattern
This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create 
an object while making sure that __only single object gets created__ .
 ## usage 
 we use it when we need to create only one instance from the class 
there is some case that I must use one instance
1. when  the instance take large space in memory so if i create multiple instance the project will be so large
2. when I open connection to database so i don't need multiple instance just one is enough

## Add to my knowledge
- Collections.shuffle(mylist); // Use to randomize the order in the list
- this.hashCode(); // it uses to create code for each instance  sp every instance have different hashcode
